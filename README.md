Problem 4.

Given the string representations of two arbritrary DFAs A and B, design an algorithm that determines whether the two DFAs recognize the same language or not.

Hint: Think of the symmetric difference between L(A) and L(B), defined as 
L(C) = (L(A) && InverseOf(L(B))) union (InverseOf(L(A)) && L(B))
